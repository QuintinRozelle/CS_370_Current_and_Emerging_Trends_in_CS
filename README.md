### Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project, I was tasked with creating an intelligent agent that would find the optimal route to solve a maze. Most of the code was prebuilt, but I was tasked with coding the artificial intelligence section. My code took in information about the maze and ran through a reinforcement learning algorithm coupled with a neural network that found the shortest path to the end of the maze by taking the action that maximized the future reward at every state encountered.

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

I think computer scientists build solutions to problems by focusing on the client's needs while also incorporating technology that optimally works toward that solution. In the case of this project, the client needed an artificial intelligence that efficiently solved a maze. This was completed by using tools (e.g., the Python programming language, Keras library, etc.) and desigining code that met the needs of the client.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I like to approach things in a stepwise and iterative approach. I prefer to build a small portion of my solution then test to ensure it is meeting the goals. Further, I keep the client's needs as the central focus of the project so that I ensure that what I am creating meets their needs and not the needs that I think they have.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to end users and the organization are similar: to ensure privacy, reduce bias, and act in a legal and ethical manner. While going through this course, I found that adhering to the GDPR laws helps to ensure ethical behavior:
- Transparency
- Limited purpose
- Minimization of data collection
- Data accuracy
- Limitations on storage durations
- Data confidentiality
